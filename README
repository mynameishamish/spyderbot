# Utilising Nikmart's Interaction Engine Node Setup #


# Interaction Engine #

To run this example:

1. clone the repo
3. run `node server.js`

# --- #

Please note motor ranges before building new positions, and try not to overextend (keeping motor between MID pos and MAX pos) for too long in any one behaviour (> 5 sec). Otherwise, motors will overload and shut down on you. The fix? Nicer motors. This does not apply to motor 2 (base).

Motor               MIN (Rest)    MID (Alert)   MAX (Up)
Base (2 or m1)      -70           0             70
Neck (3 or m2)      20.3          15.5          50
Head (3 of m4)      -6            23.3          62

CURRENT STATUS:
All definitions/positions are a bit all over the place (currently in rest.py), need to integrate everything into one clean file that can be imported
